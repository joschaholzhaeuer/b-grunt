# Basic Boilerplate

This is a very basic boilerplate to get started with. It includes a specific folder structure with some predefined HTML/SCSS and uses Git and Grunt.

## Folder Structure

The `src` folder is for development only, where you can find all of the SCSS code, uncompressed JavaScript and uncompressed images or placeholders used for development.
The `dist` folder is the one you upload on a server when deploying your project. Here are all minified and compressed files and images, automatically created by Grunt.

## Steps for installing Grunt

Step 1: Install the grunt command line interface globally 'npm install -g grunt-cli'

Step 2: Install all devDependencies 'npm install'
