# Basic Boilerplate

This is a very basic boilerplate to get started with. It includes a specific folder structure with some predefined HTML and SCSS as well as some additional useful files.

## Folder Structure

The `src` folder is for development only, where you can find all of the SCSS code, uncompressed JavaScript and uncompressed images or placeholders used for development.
The `dist` folder is the one you upload on a server when deploying your project. Here are all minified and compressed files and images, automatically created by Grunt.
